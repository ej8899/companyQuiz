## About The Project

![Sample quiz](design/scr-quiz.png)


CompanyQuiz! is intended to allow your company to deploy simple quizzes and exams to your staff to test their knowledge on various company policy and proeedures.

![End User Admin](design/scr-user.png)
A simple end user interface allows your staff to select the policy or area of testing.


![Sample quiz](design/scr-admin.png)
A more robust backend allows administrators to review all users quiz results and status, create new quizzes, and add new users for testing.  A summary is also displayed so you can see your company compliance stats at a glance.
